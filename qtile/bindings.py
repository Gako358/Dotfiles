'''
My mouse and key bindings.

String names for non-alpha-numeric keys can be found here:
>>> https://github.com/qtile/qtile/blob/develop/libqtile/xkeysyms.py

It is possible to bind keys to multiple actions (see the swap panes bindings).
When this is done, all actions are sent and the layout/window/group acts on
those that it knows about and ignores those that it doesn't.
- I've used this to group logical behaviour between layouts where they use
  different method names (in the case of moving windows) and to chain
  actions together (move group to screen and follow with focus).

I'm not being 100% consistent but in general:
    M-...  :: qtile / environment commands
    M-S... :: qtile window/group management commands (movement of windows etc)
    M-C... :: program launching
    M-A... :: utility launching

Anything bound to arrow keys is movement based. I'm having problems binding
`M-C={h,j,k,l}` which is preventing me using that for movement. (Though this
may be something to do with my own ez_keys function...!)
